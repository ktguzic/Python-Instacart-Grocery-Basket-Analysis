through an ap, already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more
information about their sales patterns. 

## Context
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database
along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same

customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale
of their products.
